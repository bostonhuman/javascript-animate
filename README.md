# JavaScript Animate

In this example, the .animate() method is used to gradually change the values of two CSS properties. Both of them have numerical values: opacity and padding-left. When the user clicks on a list item, it fades out and the text content slides to the right (This takes 500ms.) Once that is complete, a callback function removes the element. You can increase or decrease numeric values by a specific amount. Here, += 80 is used to increase the padding property by 80 pixels. (To decrease it by 80 pixels, you would use -=80.)
